# shuttleit
Event handler for Contour Design ShuttleXpress

## Work (Not?) In Progress

This is a perl script which reads the HID events from a Contour
ShuttleXpress, and translates them into keypresses.

This is scratching my own itch. I want to use mine as a media control
to send play/pause/next/prev track keys and raise/lower volume in Linux.
Thus, the actions performed by each button are hard-coded into the script.

The next logical steps would be to add command-line options for `--debug`,
`--daemon`, etc., as well as a better way for changing what each button does,
but since it already does what I need I'm not sure I'll get around to it.
Feel free to email me or add an Issue if you'd like to request something.
Of course patches are welcome too!

## Installation / Use

I've only tested this on Ubuntu 14.04, but it should work on any system where
a device file can be created to read inputs from.

1. Copy 90-shuttlexpress.rules to your udev rules directory. On Ubuntu,
   this is `/etc/udev/rules.d`:

        sudo cp 90-shuttlexpress.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

   The purpose of this entry is to tell the udev subsystem that it should
   create a world-readable device file entry at `/dev/shuttlexpress` any time
   the device is plugged in. That way, the script can be run by any user
   without root privileges.

2. Install `xdotool` if not already present (`sudo apt install xdotool`).
   This is used to send the keypresses which will be simulated by the script.

3. Plug your ShuttleXpress into a USB port and verify that the device
   `/dev/shuttlexpress` got created. Recent versions of Ubuntu use `inotify`
   so the rule should be picked up immediately; if not then try
   `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`.

4. Either manually run `shuttleit.pl`, or set it to run automatically when
   you login. On Ubuntu, this is best accomplished using the "Startup
   Applications" tool.

5. Turn the knob on your ShuttleXpress; your system volume should adjust
   accordingly.

## Hacking

If it doesn't work correctly, try fiddling with these settings:

* `$DAEMONIZE`: Set to 1 to run in background; 0 to run in foreground.
* `$DOIT`: Set to 1 to send keypresses for ShuttleXpress events; 0 to
  prevent this.
* `$DEBUG`: Set to 1 to show events on STDERR as they're read; 0 for less
  verbose output.
* `process_state`: This is the Perl sub that actually acts on the state of the
  ShuttleXpress. Sorry, this is very particular to my needs at the moment.

Try setting `$DAEMONIZE` to 0, `$DOIT` to 0, and `$DEBUG` to 1 to see if the
script is at least reading your inputs.

When `/dev/shuttlexpress` is created according to the udev rule file, every
action on the ShuttleXpress will send 5 bytes to that device. These bytes
correspond to the various states of the controls (buttons up/down, outer
ring location, position of inner dial).

In addition, the script tracks the previous state and uses this to determine
whether the up/down state of each button has changed, and whether the dial has
moved to the left or the right since the previous read.

I wrote my script in Perl because it's already installed on most \*nix distros.
There are no other external dependencies or build requirements; all of the
other options out there I could find (see below) didn't make it very easy to
get them running and in the end I couldn't get them to work.

## Others

There are a few other tools out there that basically do the same thing, but
I wasn't able to use them for various reasons. But one of them may work for you.

* The LinuxCNC project [has a ShuttleXpress](http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/drivers/shuttlexpress.html)
  driver, but it's an entire embedded distro & extracting just that tool wasn't
  feasible. [GitHub source here](https://github.com/jepler/linuxcnc-mirror).
* The [ShuttlePro project](http://freecode.com/projects/shuttlepro) on FreeCode
  has what appears to be a standalone program but I couldn't get it to build.
  It seems to be an entire GUI-based tool to also allow mapping the translations.
  [GitHub source here](https://github.com/nanosyzygy/ShuttlePRO).
* Here's [another ShuttleXpress tool on GitHub](https://github.com/threedaymonk/shuttlexpress)
  written in Scheme. I could barely figure out what Chickens and Eggs were, much
  less build the thing.
