# shuttleit
Event handler for Contour Design ShuttleXpress

## Work In Progress

This is a perl script which reads the HID events from a Contour
ShuttleXpress, and translates them into keypresses.

This is scratching my own itch. I want to use mine as a media control
to send play/pause/next/prev track keys and raise/lower volume in Linux.

I'll add better docs and a quick & dirty installer shortly.
